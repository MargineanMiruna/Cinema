# Cinema Management Project

This project seeks to improve the movie-ticket reservation experience by offering a user-friendly online booking platform. It simplifies the process for customers, offering convenient features and a smooth user experience.
Users can log in either as a Customer or as Staff.

Customer login:
1.	Membership Creation: Customers can register for membership, which offers benefits such as discounts.
2.	Movie Listings: Customers can view a list of available movies, including showtimes and genres.
3.	Easy ticket booking for individuals and groups simplifies event planning and seating arrangements.

Staff login: 
Staff members have access to the platform's content management tools, enabling them to add new movies, create showtimes, and keep schedules up-to-date for customers.

The main goals of this project are:
1.	Improved Customer Experience: The platform simplifies the booking process, saving customers time and effort.
2.	Improved Data Management for Cinemas: Moving ticket sales and customer data online allows for better data organization, sales tracking, and customer insights.
This project brings together the convenience of digital booking with the efficiency of automated data management, making the cinema experience better for both customers and staff.
